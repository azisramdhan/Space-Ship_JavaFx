This Space Shooter game was made to fulfill my future assignment (big task) in the object-oriented programming subject taught by my lecturer, Mrs. Rosa Ariani Sukamto, thanks to her who gave me the opportunity to make this game. This game is made using the Java language and the Javafx framework to create the User Interface.
